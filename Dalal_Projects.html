        The Scratch Project was my First project in this course. We used the 
        programming interface Scratch. Our game was almost like a running race 
        spanning across multiple screens. To make the game a challenge we added 
        boxes across the screen so the runner also had to avoid them. As an 
        incentive and a form of a score for the player they had to collect 3 
        stars. Before you finished the level the player was taken to a screen 
        that said: “you may only pass if you have all 3 stars” making collecting
        the starts are a requirement. I played an essential role in this project
        because of my motivation. Towards the end of the project, my partner and
        I  were having trouble setting the score feature for our game. I was so
        motivated outside of the class time I tried to fix it at home.After a 
        productive 30 minutes  I learned I was sticking the score variable in 
        the wrong loop making the score count infinitely. In this project, I 
        learned the virtue of patience and delegation. We alternated different 
        portions of code. While I was working on the score, my partner worked
        on the boxes, stars, and backgrounds. Also, we had to have the patience
        to work with scratch because it does not tell you your errors so we had 
        to look at it ourselves. The task was unpleasant but we figured it out. 
        On the left side I have embeded the full game.
