        The Scratch Project was my First project in this course. We used the 
        programming interface Scratch. Our game was almost like a running race 
        spanning across multiple screens. To make the game a challenge we added 
        boxes across the screen so the runner also had to avoid them. As an 
        incentive and a form of a score for the player they had to collect 3 
        stars. Before you finished the level the player was taken to a screen 
        that said: “you may only pass if you have all 3 stars” making collecting
        the starts are a requirement. I played an essential role in this project
        because of my motivation. Towards the end of the project, my partner and
        I  were having trouble setting the score feature for our game. I was so
        motivated outside of the class time I tried to fix it at home.After a 
        productive 30 minutes  I learned I was sticking the score variable in 
        the wrong loop making the score count infinitely. In this project, I 
        learned the virtue of patience and delegation. We alternated different 
        portions of code. While I was working on the score, my partner worked
        on the boxes, stars, and backgrounds. Also, we had to have the patience
        to work with scratch because it does not tell you your errors so we had 
        to look at it ourselves. The task of finding the errors in the code 
        was unpleasant but with teamwork we figured it out. 
        On the left side I have embeded the full game. For my Documentation click

    <p>
     This project is the photo manipulation project. Our objective was to create
     a script to assist people edit their photos in a professional manner. Our 
     theme was Juan’s submission for the Film Festival, called Midterms. In an 
     effort to promote we created photos that would have filters and masks 
     promoting this movie. This project taught me how to work through errors and 
     not give up. Me and my partner went through many technical and emotional 
     struggles. A couple days my partner was absent which made it difficult to do
     the project and communicate. These days happened to be the worst in terms of
     errors. Cloud 9, the environment we worked in had problems running our images.
     When we tried to output a PNG there would be no changes to the image. It was
     at this time I learned the powerful effect of asking for help. I asked Apollo
     for help, and together we solved this problem. The next day Juan came back 
     and we ran into more obstacles. When we tried to add a mask, the image did 
     show these changes. We spent 40 minutes trying to figure it out. At the end 
     of consulting with classmates we realized our program was killing it’s self 
     because the images were too complex. I think me and juan both exemplified 
     leadership qualities. Both of us were absent at different times during the project. 
     In order to do well both of us communicated with each other after class. If we were 
     not able to make progress in class we would work on it at home. Additionally 
     we would stay up to date on our documentation, which was our most valued deliverable.
