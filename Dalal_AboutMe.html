        <p>While this is an Engineering Portfolio, I am more interested in a    <!-- This is a spot for the first paragraph --> 
        career of Journalism. However Engineering is a second option that is also     
        on my mind. I have taken steps towards becoming a Journalist by joining
        the Club Dublin Shield which is the official school news paper provider. 
        I have also put time into engineering. Since I was 12 years old, I have 
        been spending time learning Python. I am interested in both these 
        careers because the tasks of these jobs seem fun and challenging.
        </p>
        <p>My friends have described me as loyal and trustworthy.    <!--  This is the spot for the second paragraph --> 
        During normal disputes between 2 of my friends I act as a mediator and 
        solve the problem diplomatically. Sometimes when 1 of my friends takes 
        a water bottle away from another    <!-- Ignore this gap -->
        friend the friend who had the water bottle taken away takes away 
        something valuable of the first friend. In simpler terms each friend 
        got something of the others. I try to solve the problem I take both things 
        hold them in my hand count to three and give it back to the original 
        owner. My friends let me hold both things because they trust I will not do
        anything bad to it . While these may be disputes 
        about petty things I am still diplomatic and trust worthy. In my family 
        life as well I am diplomatic. Arguments with my brother are inevitable. 
        Arguments about who gets the window seat on an Airplane still take place
        These arguments could last forever but I cut compromise where I get the 
        seat on the way there. And my brother gets the seat on the way back. 
        If there is an odd amount of flightâ€™s I try to be 
        nice and give him the seat. I can solve problems with compromises and 
        still get what I want. 
        </p>
        <p> <!-- this is for the thid paragaph in the about me section -->
        Before my Freshman Year, I took an accelerated course for Algebra I. 
        It was a 6-week course called DPIE which helped you skip a certain 
        level of math. For me, it was Algebra 1. However, a more recent and major 
        accomplishment was taking two college level classes. One was an Online 
        class that had to do with technology and media. Another class was public 
        speaking. Both these classes assisted my path to me becoming an Journalism. 
        These classes also made me even more interested in Journalism as a carrer 
        path. All threetotal courses helped me with my time management skills 
        because they were either advanced or, college-level courses.
